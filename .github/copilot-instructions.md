Your task is to help write documentation and release notes for the project, which is a repository of reusable Dataverse solutions.

The solutions are data model templates that can be customized and reused across different projects. The solution components include mostly tables, fields, and relationships. Another repository is used to configure the forms, views, workflows, and other app components.

The data models are specific to government use cases - for example in federal or state and local governments.

# Enhancing and Formatting Release Notes

Enhance release notes with additional contextual information that may be useful for implementors to know or to understand how the tables and fields could be used in a real-world scenario.

Format release notes using the example below:

# Release  X.X.X.X (MMM-DD YYYY)

-   **Brief Description of Change (Added, Changed, etc.):**  
    - A new **Example table** has been introduced to... This table is designed to...
    
-   **Another Change (Added, Changed, etc.**  
    - The new **Impact table** has been created to...
