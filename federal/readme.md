# Federal Application Starter Templates (FAST) Overview

The **Federal Application Starter Templates (FAST)** library provides a growing collection of reusable Power Platform modules designed to accelerate mission modernization and digital transformation in the public sector. Each module delivers a **baseline data model, forms, and business logic** aligned to the Government Common Data Model, with the flexibility to extend and integrate into broader enterprise solutions.These templates are intended to be deployed individually or combined as part of a larger ecosystem, giving agencies a **modular toolkit** to quickly stand up secure, compliant, and mission-ready applications. 

> While initially tailored for federal use cases, the templates will be migrated over time into a **broader Government template framework** with a namespace and design patterns that are equally applicable to **State, Local, Tribal, Territorial (SLTT) governments** and the **Defense Industrial Base (DIB)**. This evolution ensures maximum reusability and alignment across all levels of government.

By adopting FAST modules, organizations gain a head start on modernization initiatives while maintaining flexibility to tailor solutions for their mission-specific needs.
