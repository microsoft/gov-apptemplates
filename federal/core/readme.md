# Core Utility App Overview

The Core Utility App is a foundational, reusable module within the Microsoft Federal Application Starter Templates, purpose-built to accelerate mission modernization and digital transformation using Power Apps. This solution provides a centralized, enterprise-ready interface for managing essential records, reference data, and lookup information, all aligned with the Core [Government Data Model](https://github.com/microsoft/gov-datamodels) . It is designed to be easily extended or integrated into broader Power Platform solutions, supporting both greenfield and modernization projects.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Centralized Reference Data Management:** Offers a single source of truth for common data entities, reducing duplication and inconsistencies across applications and business processes.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Built for easy customization and extension, allowing agencies or organizations to tailor the solution to their unique requirements while maintaining a strong data foundation.
- **Accelerated Solution Development:** Provides pre-built data structures, forms, and logic, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of new Power Apps solutions.

## App Organization

The Core Utility App is organized into four primary sections, each supporting a broad set of business and regulatory needs:

- **People:** Manages individuals, personnel types, organizational units and types, initiatives, clearance levels, grade ranks, pay grades, and job series. This section supports HR, access control, onboarding, and reporting needs, and can be integrated with identity management or personnel systems.
- **Places:** Includes countries, states/provinces, and locations, providing standardized references for addresses, jurisdiction, and facility management. This enables consistent geospatial and facility data across the enterprise.
- **Things:** Covers fiscal periods, products, and other tangible or intangible assets, supporting financial reporting, inventory, procurement, and lifecycle management. This section can be extended to track additional asset types as needed.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Manages privacy consents, legal authorities, analyses, impacts, risk items, compliance frameworks, categories, and requirements. This supports auditability, policy alignment, and regulatory compliance, and can be integrated with policy management or risk assessment tools.

## Typical Use Cases

- As a foundational data layer for new Government Power Apps and Dynamics 365 solutions, ensuring consistent reference data across modules.
- As a shared utility module in a larger enterprise low-code environment, reducing redundant configuration and strengthening systemwide data management.
- As a starting point for agencies seeking to modernize legacy systems or standardize data management practices.

## Getting Started

The Core Utility App can be deployed as a standalone solution or as part of a broader suite of Government App Templates. It is recommended to review the included documentation and tailor the app to your organizationâ€™s specific needs and data governance requirements.
